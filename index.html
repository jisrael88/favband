			<h2>Band Overview</h2>
			<p>
				The E Street Band was founded in October 1972, but it was not formally named until September 1974. Springsteen has put together other backing bands during his career, but the E Street Band has been together more or less continuously since its inception.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="members">
			<h2>Original and Current Band Members</h2>
			<p>	
				The original lineup included Garry Tallent (bass), Clarence Clemons (saxophone), Danny Federici (keyboards, accordion), Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards). Since then, Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici have passed away.
				The current members of the band are Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Van Zandt (guitar and vocals), Patti Scialfa (vocals), Max Weinberg (drums), Garry Tallent (bass), Roy Bittan (piano and keyboards), and Nils Lofgren (guitar). 
				Additionally, Soozie Tyrell, Charles Giordano, Everett Bradley, Jake Clemons, Barry Danielian, Clark Gayton, Curtis King, Eddie Manion, Cindy Mizelle, Michelle Moore, Tom Morello, and Curt Ramm are all unofficial members of the band.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="orgins">
			<h2>Band Origins</h2>
			<p>
				The band took its name from the street in Belmar, New Jersey, where Sancious' mother lived. She allowed the band to rehearse in her garage. Tourists to the area seeking sight of early Springsteen haunts often mistakenly believe the house was on the corner of E Street and 10th Avenue, perhaps due to the song "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" about the band's beginnings. The Sancious house was at 1107 E Street with the garage squeezed between the house and the southside fence.
				Springsteen's debut Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. was released in January 1973, and the band's first national tour began in October 1972. Sancious, even though he played on the album, missed that first tour. It was not until June 1973 that he began appearing regularly on stage with the band.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="now">
			<h2>The Band Now</h2>
			<p>
				On September 10, 2020, Springsteen announced his twentieth studio album, Letter to You which will be released on October 23, 2020. The album marks the first release featuring the E Street Band since 2014's High Hopes.
				In a September 20, 2020 interview with Rolling Stone, Springsteen said that he didn't expect to tour again until at least 2022 saying “My antenna tells me, at best, 2022. And I would consider the concert industry lucky if it happens then. I’m going to consider myself lucky if I lose just a year of touring life. Once you hit 70, there’s a finite amount of tours and a finite amount of years that you have. And so you lose one or two, that’s not so great. Particularly because I feel the band is capable of playing at the very, very, very top, or better than, of its game right now. And I feel as vital as I’ve ever felt in my life.… It’s not being able to do something that is a fundamental life force, something I’ve lived for since I was 16 years old.”
